This non invasive slide-show image gallery works on the standard Wordpress image gallery and allows to insert images using the Wordpress media gallery.

== Description ==
A really simple image gallery based on the default Wordpress media gallery short-code.
Just install it and any gallery defined using the default Wordpress image gallery short-code will become a smart, beautiful, responsive image gallery.

If you want to change the default behaviour of the image gallery (modify transactions, pagination of thumbnails, etc.) you need to purchase the <a href="https://pupunzi.com/wpPlus/go-plus.php?plugin_prefix=TGAL">Plus version</a>.
